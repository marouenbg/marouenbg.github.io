# About me

I am passionate about computational biology and aiming to take on the grand challenge of analyzing the unprecedent scale of biological data.

### Education

- Ph.D. in Biology at the [University of Luxembourg](http://uni.lu). [Doctoral Dissertation](https://github.com/marouenbg/PhD-thesis).
- [Master in Bioinformatics](http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/m2bi/) at Université Denis Diderot, Paris, France. This is where I got my first formal training in bioinformatics through the support of inspiring mentors like Prof. Catehrine Etchebest at Paris Diderot and Dr. Zsolt Böcksei at Sanofi.
- Docteur en Pharmacie at the University of Monastir, [Faculty of Pharmacy](http://www.fphm.rnu.tn/), Monastir, Tunisia. I am a pharmacist by training, I took courses and performed internships in clinical biology. I was mentored by Col. Mehdi Dridi, and supervised by Dr. Mariem Ben Hmida for the research project.
