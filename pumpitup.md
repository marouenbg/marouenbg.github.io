# Pump it up!

The levodopa feedback controlled pump.

_In 2015, I imagined with [Dr. Johan Thunberg](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=EG4ZBbcAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of Luxembourg a subcutaneous levodopa pump that adapts the infusion speed with respect to three feedback sensors: i) hand shaking, ii) brain local
field potential, and iii) real time levodopa concentrations in the brain.

## White paper
We layed down [our vision for the levodopa pump](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07232) and designed a mathematical model to simulate its impact on the control of Parkinson's Disease.
