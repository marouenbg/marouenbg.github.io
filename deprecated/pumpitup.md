# Pump it up!

In 2014, I imagined with [Dr. Johan Thunberg](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=EG4ZBbcAAAAJ&hl=en) at the University of Luxembourg a subcutaneous levodopa pump that adapts the infusion speed with respect to three feedback sensors: i) hand shaking, ii) brain local
field potential, and iii) real time levodopa concentrations in the brain.

### White paper
We layed down [our vision for the levodopa pump](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07232) and designed a mathematical model to simulate its impact on the control of Parkinson's Disease.

### Awards

#### Falling Walls Luxembourg 2015
We were third in the [Falling Walls Lab](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/universite/actualites/a_la_une/pranjul_shah_is_the_falling_walls_lab_winner) innovation competition and won a 500 eur award to pursue the project.

Team: Marouen Ben Guebila and Johan Thunberg.

#### Hacking Health Camp 2018
We won two awards in one of the most renown health hackathons, which took place in Strasbourg, France.

The first award was from the [insurance group VYV](https://www.groupe-vyv.fr/).

The second award was from the [French syndicate of medical practioneers](http://www.lesml.org/).

Team: Marouen Ben Guebila, Aurélien Michot, and Quentin.

### Prototype
We devoloped the prototype of the pump in the hacking health camp 2018.
We used a Raspberry Pi and a three axis accelerometer to [analyze](https://github.com/marouenbg/pump-it-up) the hand movemenets and detect frequencies associated with dyskinesia or akinesia in Parkinson disease.

### Market
Subcutaneous pumps in Parkinson's disease were applied to the administration of apomorphine. Levodopa could be continuously administrated through jejunal pumps.

The subcutanous injection of levodopa is in development by [neuroderm](http://neuroderm.com/), but the feedback control remains a technical and theoretical challenge.

This page wouldn't exist without the passion and determination of two inspiring people: Johan Thunberg and Aurélien Michot.
Aurélien Michot was essential in the development of the prototype in the Hacking Health Camp and Johan Thunberg developed the theoretical controller for the pump.
